Will maybe try to implement the challenge objectives, leavingthem here for ease of access:
1.   Rather than squares being the same color throughout the grid, randomize the squaresâ€™ RGB values with each interaction.
2.  Additionally, implement a progressive darkening effect where each interaction darkens the square by 10%. The goal is to achieve a fully black (or completely colored) square in only ten interactions.
Hint: The opacity CSS property is useful here. To learn how to use it, check this MDN docs article about the opacity CSS property.
